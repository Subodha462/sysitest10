        href="mailto:privacy@sysi.org">privacy@sysi.org</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Controlling your personal information</strong></p>
    <p>You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:</p>
    <p>Whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the Services, look for a box that you can click to indicate that you
      do not want the information to be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes. If you have previously agreed to
      us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing
      to or emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sysi.org">privacy@sysi.org</a>.</p>
    <p>We will not sell your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by
      law. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think
      you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen.</p>
    <p>You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998. A
      small fee will be payable.</p>
    <p>If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us
      as soon as possible, at the above address. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.</p>
    <p><strong>Sharing the information we collect</strong></p>
    <p>In our regular course of business, we do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer personally identifiable
      information to third parties who are not our affiliates or event sponsors without your consent to do so. We may,
      however, disclose personally identifiable information: to our affiliated companies, agencies, carriers, agency
      clients, event sponsors, third party service providers and/or agents, as reasonably necessary to provide you with
      the Services you have requested or market additional services; as required by law or legal process; in response to
      lawful requests for information by governmental agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, authorized to
      request such information; to enforce our contractual agreements, including investigation of potential violations
      thereof; to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies and to otherwise
      protect our interests; to help detect and prevent harm to persons or property or otherwise to protect public
      safety; to third parties that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, third parties that
      host or operate our Services, analyze data, perform email list management services, provide customer service, or
      provide public relations and marketing services; and to vendors of products and services that are offered through
      the Services.</p>
    <p>We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any
      specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users on the
      Services and the geographic distribution of our users). As such, in no way to limit the foregoing, we may share
      aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as industry organizations, and
      prospective affiliates.</p>
    <p>We do not enable third parties, except for certain of our agencies, to collect information directly from users
      while they interact with Services. Our agencies only collect and use information at our direction and only to
      support the functioning of the Services and to perform analytics. Our agencies may not share this information with
      third parties.</p>
    <p>As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could sell or buy subsidiaries or business
      units. In any such transaction, as well in the event all or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a
      third party, personal information of our users will generally be one of the transferred assets. We reserve the
      right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party.</p>
    <p>Information collected by or sent to us may be stored and processed in any country in which we and our affiliates,
      subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. We reserve the right to transfer your personal information
      outside of the country where you reside and/or from which you use our Services. By using our Services you consent
      to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
    <p><strong>Links to other websites</strong></p>
    <p>Our Services may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you have
      used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website.
      Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst
      visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and
      look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p>
    <p><strong>How long is your information kept by us?</strong></p>
    <p>We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to order to: provide the use of our Services;
      communicate with you regarding other Services that we offer; comply with applicable laws, regulations, and court
      orders; enforce our contractual agreements; or fulfill any of the purposes for which we collected the personal
      information as listed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>However, you can choose to or delete your entire account at any time. If you delete your entire account, all data
      associated with your account is destroyed. Understand that SYSI has no control where data form a share may be
      printed or retained. We have no obligation to keep private any sensitive information or personally identifiable
      information that you have made available to other participants using these functions.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>We may use “cookies” to assist in web security, data collection and to track visitor Services usage and trends to
      help us better serve you. A “Cookie” is a simple text file stored on your computer or device for use by a browser.
      Certain Services features may only be available through the placement of a cookie. You can choose to accept or
      decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting
      to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Services.</p>
    <p>The use of cookies is a standard practice among internet web sites; most internet browsers permit a user to
      accept, decline or delete cookies. We may use persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the
      Services. Specifically, we may use persistent cookies to track whether you are logged into the Services. A
      persistent cookie may remain on your local device for an extended period of time.</p>
    <p>We may set a persistent cookie to store how you came to the Services and what items you interact with during your
      visit. Persistent cookies also enable tracking and targeting the interests of our users to enhance their
      experience on the Services. If you reject cookies, you will still be able to view contents through the Services,
      but your ability to use some areas of the Services may be limited. Some of our business partners (e.g., analytical
      tracking software providers and other third-party widgets like youtube.com) may use cookies and tracking
      technologies on the Services. We have no access to or control over these cookies or tracking technologies. This
      Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies on our Services and does not cover the use of cookies or tracking
      technologies by any such business partner.</p>
    <p>Certain countries, including members of the European Union, require your consent to the use of cookies when you
      visit the Services. Please note that you will not be able to opt out of receiving certain cookies that are
      strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by you.</p>
    <p>If you do not accept cookies, your browser can be set to not automatically accept cookies from being stored or to
      inform you whenever a site requests storing a cookie. Previously stored cookies can also be deleted through the
      browser. See the help pages of your browser for more information. However, be aware that some areas or functions
      of the SYSI website depends on cookies and may not work if you delete or not to accept cookies. Please contact us
      at <a href="mailto:privacy@sysi.org">privacy@sysi.org</a> for more information about the cookies used on the
      website.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we use a site analytics service, Google Analytics to collect information about use of the Services.
      The Services analytics service collects information such as how often users visit the Services, what pages they
      visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Services. We use the information we
      get from the Services analytics service only to improve the Services. The Services analytics service collects
      activity data only, it does not collect your name or other identifying information. Although the Services
      analytics service plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you
      visit the Services, the cookie cannot be used beyond sysi.org or by anyone but the Services analytics service. You
      can prevent the Services analytics service from recognizing you on return visits to the Services by disabling
      cookies on your browser.</p>
    <p><strong>Choices regarding cookies</strong></p>
    <p>Certain countries, including members of the European Union, require your consent to the use of cookies when you
      visit the Services. Please note that you will not be able to opt out of receiving certain cookies that are
      strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by you.</p>
    <p>If you do not accept cookies, your browser can be set to not automatically accept cookies from being stored or to
      inform you whenever a site requests storing a cookie. Previously stored cookies can also be deleted through the
      browser. See the help pages of your browser for more information. However, be aware that some areas or functions
      of the SYSI website depends on cookies and may not work if you delete or not to accept cookies. Please contact us

      website.</p>
    <p><strong>Protecting your personal information</strong></p>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or
      disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure
      the information we collect online. We follow commercially accepted industry standards to protect the personal
      information submitted to or collected by us, both during transmission and once we receive it. While we strive to
      use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the
      internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. In the
      event of an inadvertent disclosure of your personal information, we will take all commercially reasonable steps to
      limit and remedy the disclosure as required by the applicable law. In light of the foregoing, your use and access
      of the Services is at your own risk. If you have any questions about security of our Services, please contact us
      in the manner set forth under the heading “Contact Us” below.</p>
    <p>For site security purposes this service monitors network traffic. Anyone using this system consents to the
      monitoring of their use. Unauthorized use, tampering with or modification of this system—or its supporting
      hardware or software—may violate federal or other statutes and may subject the violator to criminal and civil
      penalties. In the event of unauthorized intrusion, all relevant information regarding possible violation of law
      may be provided to law enforcement officials.</p>
    <p>Please note that electronic communication, particularly email, is not necessarily secure against interception.
      Please do not send sensitive data (e.g., Social Security, bank account, or credit card numbers) by email or web
      form.</p>
    <p><strong>Can children use the Services?</strong></p>
    <p>The Services are intended for the use of users who are at least 18 years of age. The Services are not directed to
      persons under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect or solicit information from, market to or accept services
      from persons under the age of 18 years old. If we become aware that a person under the age of 18 has provided us
      with personal information, we will take steps to remove such personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>How far does our responsibility extend?</strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Services that are owned and operated by us. The Services and our
      communications to you may contain links to other third-party sites that may offer products or services that our
      users might find useful. These third-party sites may request information from you. In such instances, the
      collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that third
      party site. We do not and cannot control the privacy policies, contents or links that appear on these third-party
      sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites or services before providing any
      of them with your personal information. We accept no responsibility or liability for other third-party sites or
      services.</p>
    <p><strong>Your rights under GDPR</strong></p>
    <p>If you are a resident of or are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you may have certain rights under
      the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).</p>
    <p>In general, under the GDPR you have the following rights:</p>
    <p><strong>Right to information.</strong> This right provides you with the ability to ask SYSI for information about
      what personal information is being processed and the rationale for such processing.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to access.</strong> This right provides you with the ability to get access to your personal
      information that is being processed. This request provides the right for you to see or view your own personal
      information, as well as to request copies of the personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to rectification.</strong> This right provides you with the ability to ask for modifications to
      your personal information in case you believe that this personal information is not up to date or accurate.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to withdraw consent.</strong> This right provides you with the ability to withdraw a previously
      given consent for processing of your Personal information for a purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to object.</strong> This right provides you with the ability to object to the processing of your
      personal information.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to object to automated processing.</strong> This right provides you with the ability to object to a
      decision based on automated processing.</p>
    <p><strong>Right to be forgotten.</strong> Also known as right to erasure, this right provides you with the ability
      to ask for the deletion of your data. This will generally apply to situations where a customer relationship has
      ended. This is not an absolute right, and depends on SYSI’s retention policies.</p>
    <p><strong>Right for data portability.</strong> This right provides you with the ability to ask for transfer of your
      personal information. As part of such request, you may ask for your personal information to be provided back to
      you or transferred to another controller.</p>
    <p>Should you request a copy of your personal information, we will supply it to you. The first copy will be provided
      free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. Should you request the deletion of your
      personal information, SYSI will generally do so as soon as practicable, although your right to have your personal
      information deleted is subject to exceptions, such as, for example, compliance with a legal obligation or for the
      establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
    <p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal
      right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU
      member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
    <p>Contact SYSI at <a href="mailto:privacy@sysi.org">privacy@sysi.org</a> if you have concerns regarding your
      personal information, or wish to exercise any of these listed rights.</p>
    <p><strong>California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
    <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), California residents have certain rights relating to
      collection, use, and sharing of their personal information for companies that do a minimum amount of business in
      or with California residents.</p>
    <p>We currently do not meet the minimum necessary requirements to be subject to the CCPA. However, we also do not
      sell your personal information (though sharing your information with our affiliates and event sponsors may be
      considered selling under the CCPA or other applicable law) and will not do so in the future without providing you
      with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of such sale, if required by law. Except as provided in this Privacy
      Policy, we do not offer financial incentives associated with our collection, use, or disclosure of your personal
      information.</p>
    <p>If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what personal information has been
      collected about you, and to access that information. You also have the right to request deletion of your personal
      information, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow us to retain and use certain personal information
      notwithstanding your deletion request. You have the right to opt-out of sale of your information and the right to
      non-discrimination. You may also send your request to us by contacting us at the address below under “How Can You
      Contact Us?”.</p>
    <p>Separate from the CCPA, California’s Shine the Light Act (California Civil Code Section 1798.83) gives California
      residents the right to ask companies what personal information they share with third parties for those third
      parties’ direct marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>Also, the Shine the Light Act permits customers who are California residents and who have provided us with
      “personal information” (as that term is defined in CA Civ. Code Section 1798.83) to request certain information
      about the disclosure of that information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a
      California resident with questions regarding this, please contact us in the manner set forth under the heading
      “How Can You Contact Us?” below.</p>
    <p><strong>Transfer of personal information</strong></p>
    <p>Our computer systems are currently cloud based, so your personal information may be processed by us in various
      countries. If you use the website and/or services offered on the website as a customer or visitor from outside the
      United States, by using the website and/or services offered on the website, you agree to this Privacy Policy and
      you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level
      of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that
      information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Inquiries and complaints</strong></p>
    <p>If you believe SYSI maintains your personal information in one of the Services discussed in this Privacy Policy,
      you may direct inquiries or complaints to <a href="mailto:privacy@sysi.org">privacy@sysi.org</a>. If you have an
      unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily after 45 days, and you are
      located in the EEA, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</p>
    <p><strong>Modifications of this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p>Each time you use or access the Services, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, when
      you use the Services, you should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the top of the Privacy
      Policy) and review any changes since the last version. We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect
      changes in our Services and/or business practices. You are encouraged to check regularly for any changes to this
      Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about
      you. We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of user information
      collected in the past without the consent of affected users. You agree that your continued use of the Services
      shall constitute your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as revised.</p>
    <p><strong>What law applies to this Privacy Policy?</strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles
      of conflict of law. If you are outside of the United States, your information will be processed and stored in the
      United States and you consent to such processing and storage under the laws of the United States.</p>
    <p><strong>Contact us</strong></p>
    <p>To contact us with your questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy or our information collection and
      dissemination practices, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@sysi.org">privacy@sysi.org</a> or
